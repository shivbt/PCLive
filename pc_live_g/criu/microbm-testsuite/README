BUILD and CLEAN
===============
To build, use `make'. It builds two binaries i.e., `bm' and `bmcli'
To clean object files, execute `make clean'
To clean text files, execute `make cleantxt'

USAGE
=====

Make sure `tmpfs' is mounted in the system. 

Step 1: Launch the `bm' executable. It should run until killed.
Step 2: Use the `bmcli' to carry-out different actions. Use `bmcli --help' to know the usage syntax.

Usage: ./bmcli <--list |-l|--action|-a> [OPTIONS]
OPTIONS
-P
	 with --list or -l, lists all processes. No arguments necessary
	 with --action or -a, the followig actions are allowed.
	 <-c> Create a process
	 <-d> Kill a process, Must provide -p option specifying the pid, see below
-F
	 with --list or -l, lists all files opened by the process. The pid must be provided with -p argument
	 with --action or -a, the followig actions are allowed.
	 <-c> Open a file for a process specified with -p option
	 <-d> Close the file (fd specified by -i) opened by a process (specified with -p)
	 Must provide -p and -i option specifying the pid and fd, respectively
	 <-w> Writes pages (specified by -s) to a file (fd specified by -i) for a process specified with -p option
	 Must provide -p, -i, -s option specifying the pid, fd and pages, respectively
	 <-r> Reads pages (specified by -s) from a file (fd specified by -i) for a process specified with -p option
	 Must provide -p, -i, -s option specifying the pid, fd and pages, respectively
	 <-k> Seeks to a file offset (specified by -s) for a process specified with -p option
	 Must provide -p, -i, -s option specifying the pid, fd and pages, respectively
	 Note: for read, write and seek, the size or offset is specified by -s option in pages.

-T
	 with --list or -l, lists all threads active in the process. The pid must be provided with -p argument
	 with --action or -a, the followig actions are allowed.
	 <-c> Create a thread within a process specified with -p option
	 <-d> Terminate the thread (tid specified by -i) opened by a process (specified with -p)
	 Must provide -p and -i option specifying the pid and tid, respectively
-M
	 with --list or -l, lists all memory areas mapped by the process. The pid must be provided with -p argument
	 with --action or -a, the followig actions are allowed.
	 <-c> Create a memory map within a process specified with -p option.
	 Size of the mapping (in pages) must be provided with -s option 
	 <-d> Unmap the memory map (mapid specified by -i) created by a process (specified with -p)
	 Must provide -p and -i option specifying the pid and mapid, respectively
	 <-w> Writes pages (specified by -s) to the start of memory (mapid specified by -i) for process specified with -p option
	 Must provide -p, -i, -s option specifying the pid, mapid and pages, respectively
	 <-r> Reads pages (specified by -s) from the start of memory (mapid specified by -i) for process specified with -p option
	 Must provide -p, -i, -s option specifying the pid, fd and pages, respectively
	 Note: for read and write, the size is specified by -s option in pages. Operations performed at the starting address

-p <pid>
	 Specify the PID of the process for which the action is performed

-i <id>
	 Specify the ID of the construct (file, memory or thread)on which the action is performed

-s <pages>
	 Specify the size in pages for memory and file operations
Examples:
            To list all processes, execute `bmcli -l -P'
            To create a new process, execute `bmcli -a -P -c'
            To open a file for any process, execute `bmcli -a -c -p <pid> -F` 
            To list all files by any process, execute `bmcli -l -p <pid> -F` 
            To close a file by any process, execute `bmcli -a -d -p <pid> -i <fd> -F` 
            To read two pages from the current offset of a file, execute `bmcli -a -r -p <pid> -i <fd> -s 2 -F`
